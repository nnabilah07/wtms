## Description
WTMS is a Flutter-based mobile application that allows workers to manage tasks and profiles effectively. The app provides features such as worker registration, login, and profile management. It connects to a backend PHP server with a MySQL database for data management.

## Features
**Worker Registration**: Workers can register by providing full name, email, password, phone number, and address. This data is sent to the backend via an HTTP POST request.

**Worker Login**: Users can log in using their email and password. On successful login, the app retrieves and displays the worker's full profile.

**Profile Management**: After logging in, users can view and manage their profile, which includes personal information like name, email, phone number, and address.

**Session Persistence**: SharedPreferences is used to maintain the userâ€™s login state, so the worker stays logged in until they log out.

**Secure Password Storage**: Passwords are securely hashed using SHA1 before storing them in the database.

## Screens
**1. Registration Screen**:
      -Fields: Full Name, Email, Password (hidden), Phone Number, Address
      -Validation: All fields are required, email format is validated, and password must be at least 6 characters.
